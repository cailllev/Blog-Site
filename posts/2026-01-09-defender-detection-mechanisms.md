# Defender's different Detection Mechanisms

This post is based on the observations from my [EDRi Framework](https://github.com/cailllev/EDR-Introspection).<br>
TL;DL: EDRi attaches itself to the Antimalware and Kernel ETW traces, and hooks ntdll of MsMpEng.exe, to supervise all actions MDE takes against my attack.exe<br>
Start [here](/post/2025-12-04-defender-detection-engines) if you do not know about heuristic scans, emulations, memory scans or behaviour tracking.

## EDRi Log Analysis
The output of the EDRi framework is analysed and interpreted, given these four attacks:

* [CobaltStrike loader, no bypass](https://github.com/cailllev/EDR-Introspection/blob/d1c16c36e0e7a16cbd474df7331a3c7b5b6fec27/EDRi/dumps/events/MDE-vs-ProcInject-standard.csv)
* [CobaltStrike loader, obfuscated](https://github.com/cailllev/EDR-Introspection/blob/d1c16c36e0e7a16cbd474df7331a3c7b5b6fec27/EDRi/dumps/events/MDE-vs-ProcInject-obfuscation.csv)
* [Lsass dumper, no bypass](https://github.com/cailllev/EDR-Introspection/blob/d1c16c36e0e7a16cbd474df7331a3c7b5b6fec27/EDRi/dumps/events/MDE-vs-LsassReader-standard.csv)
* [Lsass dumper, deconditioning](https://github.com/cailllev/EDR-Introspection/blob/d1c16c36e0e7a16cbd474df7331a3c7b5b6fec27/EDRi/dumps/events/MDE-vs-LsassReader-deconditioning.csv)

The logs are also available as nicely formatted and pre-filtered Google sheets [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17SLAfnBD9_jk4VrKUqm-2ZQ_pcJcnw-Z?usp=sharing).<br><br>

The goal of the EDRi framework is to observe what the EDR does, therefore 2 undetected and 2 detected attacks are analysed further.<br>
Try to guess which attacks are undetected, source code is [here](https://github.com/cailllev/EDR-Introspection/tree/master/attacks).

* CobaltStrike loader (obfuscated) is detected as a generic loader (Trojan/Bearfoos) when storing on disk. 
* Lsass dumper (no bypass) can be executed but is frozen after the lsass process is opened and MiniDumpWriteDump is called.
* Generating a CobaltStrike loader (with default config) as raw bytes, storing the shellcode as an array, allocating memory, writing and invoking the shellcode still worked in 2025. Who would've guessed?
* The lsass dumper also works, when using deconditioning. This is still a bit of magic, more [here](/post/2025-12-05-decondition-everything).

## Observed Mechanisms
The listed mechanisms below can be found in the Microsoft-Antimalware-Engine ETW trace, as individual events.<br>
The mechanisms are named after the event operation, task or message. There is no systematic way Microsoft labeled these.<br>
The EDRi framework is my master's thesis (link follows), the analysis of the logs is a part of it and took substantial amount of time and nerves.<br>
The table below is based on the analysis over all 4 EDRi logs, and the mechanisms are observed in all logs and in the same ordering.

| Mechanism        | Event ID | Assumed Objective(s)                                                                                                                     |
|------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| stream scan      | 32       | This represents the heuristics step (engine), gets static information                                                                    |
| MetaStore insert | 44       | Stores extracted identifiers from heuristics and emulations                                                                              |
| MetaStore query  | 44       | Gets identifiers, used to decide what further analysis must be done                                                                      |
| scan             | 1        | This represents the complete emulation step (engine)                                                                                     |
| MOAC lookup      | 36       | Used to check if a file should be emulated or not                                                                                        |
| UfsScanFile      | 30       | The actual emulation of the file                                                                                                         |
| UfsScanProc      | 32       | The actual emulation (of a process?)                                                                                                     |
| GetHashes        | 43       | Extracts identifiers (cryptographic hashes) after an emulation, sometimes for retrieval of info in heuristics phase (stream scan)        |
| UfsScanProc      | 32       | Scans the loaded modules in a process                                                                                                    |
| SpyNet report    | 43       | Bundles identifiers, submits them to Microsoft’s cloud to request a verdict (or simply Microsoft’s data collection of known executables) |

### Data only in Threat-Intelligence
AllocVM and ProtectVM events indicate memory allocation or memory permission changes (to RW, then to RX) inside MsMpEng itself.<br>
This is always linked to an emulation of your executable. Either sequence of events may *preceed* such an emulation:

* UfsScanFileTask start, NtCreateFile your.exe with access=0x120081, NtCreate your.exe with access=0x120089 (read data, read attr, read EA, read control, sync)
* UfsScaProcTask start, NtOpenProcess your.exe with access=0x418 (ProcVmOperation, ProcVmRead, ProcQueryInfo)



### Memory Reads
All memory reads by MsMpEng are preceeded by a NtOpenProcess system call. This system call is also logged in the **Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Audit-API-Calls** ETW trace.<br>
The event log also includes the desiredaccess field, indicating what operation will be done. Observed use-cases:<br>

| desired access | rights | subsequent actions | interpretation |
|----------------|--------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0x410          | ProcVmRead,ProcQueryInfo | NtInformationProcess InfoClass=Basic | memory scan | 
| 0x418          | ProcVmOperation,ProcVmRead,ProcQueryInfo | NtQueryInformationProcess InfoClass=Session,Basic | get loaded modules (LDR) |
| 0x600          | ProcSetInfo,ProcQueryInfo | NtQueryInformationProcess InfoClass=Logging | get logging info? |
| 0x1000         | ProcQueryLimitedInfo | NtQueryInformationProcess  InfoClass=Session,ThreadPagePrio | ?? |
| 0x1010         | ProcVmRead,ProcQueryLimitedInfo | NtQueryInformationProcess InfoClass=Session,Basic | ?? |
| 0x1410         | ProcVmRead,ProcQuery(Limited)Info | NtQueryInformationProcess InfoClass=Session,Basic,Wow64 + NtReadVirtualMemory | quick memory scan (only first LDR) |
| 0x101000       | Sync,ProcQueryLimitedInfo | NtQueryInformationProcess InfoClass=Session,ImageFileName | get exe name |

TL;DR: If MsMpEng opens your process with ProcessVmRead rights (0x10), it's probably gonna read some things.<br>
If it also includes ProcessQueryInformation (0x400), it's probably gonna read a lot of things.<br>
If it opens it with Syncronize rights (0x10'0000), it may wants to do a UfsScan 

## Conclusion
It should be able to predict MDE's (MsMpEng's) actions with just observing the **Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Audit-API-Calls** ETW trace.<br>
The **desiredaccess** field from the event **PsOpenProcess**, eventID 5, can be combined with the above observations.<br>
It is then possible to create **AURA** malware, in the sense of Access-based Unintended Revealed Actions (admin rights needed tho).

## Future Work
* do [more attacks](https://github.com/cailllev/EDR-Introspection/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#create-own-attack)
* analyse more logs
* verify above findings
* create **AURA** malware, test hypothesis
