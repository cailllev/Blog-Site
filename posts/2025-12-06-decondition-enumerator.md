# Decondition Enumerator
This is a continuation of the earlier [Decondition Everything](/post/2025-12-05-decondition-everything) post.

## Cooldown Time
I.e. when the cache is reset after `a_pi == Detected` (known bad) or `a_pi == cutoff` (deconditioned).<br>
From testing: can be as little as <b>5-15 minutes</b>

## How does the Process Identification work?
### Test-Conduction
* Define a single difference between `A.exe` and `A'.exe`
* execute `A.exe` to be detected, i.e. no deconditioning
* then execute `A'.exe` with deconditioning
  * if also detected => `PI(A.exe) == PI(A'.exe)` --> expected
  * if not detected => `PI(A.exe) != PI(A'.exe)` --> unexpected, may give a hint how PI works
* example:
```powershell
.\LsassReader\tested\LsassReader-compile1.exe
> no decon
> detected

.\LsassReader\tested\LsassReader-compile2.exe 20
> 20 rounds of decon
> still detected --> same PI --> expected
```

### Test-Files
Tested exe files see [Decondition-Enumerator/LsassReader/tested/](https://github.com/cailllev/Decondition-Enumerator/tree/master/LsassReader/tested).

### Test-Results
* Exe Name different: PI same
* Compile Date different: PI same
* Imphash (+SSDeep +TLSH) different: PI same
* ???
